Project Scenario
Rekall Corporation is a fictional company that specializes in offering virtual reality experiences based on images that customers upload.
These experiences could include dream vacations, adventures, or even secret missions.
Rekall guarantees that these virtual reality experiences will feel real.
Rekall is about to go live with their business, and they need penetration testers to find any vulnerabilities within their technical systems.
Rekall has a brand new web application and several Windows and Linux servers that manage their businesses.
